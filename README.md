# Writing An Interpreter in C++

Follow me as I write an interpreter in C++ and cry every day ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.

The project is an interpreter for the Monkey programming language from the book
[Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).

## My History with C++

I learned C++ just like how normal CompE kids do, which is in second year
University. It was my first "serious" programming language when I didn't know
any better how much easier it could be. After finishing [my first C++ big
school project](https://github.com/cbebe/Checkers-AI), I learned JavaScript and
never looked back at C++.

I learned more about programming fundamentals after that, and how computers
work in general. I tried picking up C++ again in 4th year for my first
Operating Systems assignment and quickly got overwhelmed. I ended up doing the
assignment in C, which I found way simpler.

I ended up doing the last assignment in C++ (it was the only other option for a
programming language) because I was too lazy to implement my own hashtable in
C, but I kept it C-style with only a little bit of OOP sprinkled in.

## Why C++ Now

- I'm a big boy programmer now who can use StackOverflow and ChatGPT
- To remind myself how much better "modern" programming languages are
- To learn new C++ features since I haven't seriously touched it in almost 3
  years (if I'm being honest, I have never seriously touched C++)
